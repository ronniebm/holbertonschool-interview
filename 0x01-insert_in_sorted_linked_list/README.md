# 0x01-insert_in_sorted_linked_list
For this interview practice algorithm, there is a sorted linked list that you have to insert a number into.

[Insert in sorted linked list](/0x01-insert_in_sorted_linked_list/0-insert_number.c)
* Write a function `listint_t *insert_node(listint_t **head, int number)` in C that inserts a number into a sorted singly linked list:
  * `head` is a pointer to the head of the list to insert into.
  * `number` is the number to sort and insert into the singly linked list.
  * Returns the address of the new node or `NULL` if failed.

### test_files
The test_files/ directory contains files used to test the output of the algorithm locally and all given source code for reference, including the lists.h header file.
